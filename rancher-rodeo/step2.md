Rancher can manage and deploy Kubernetes on a cloud provider, such as AWS, or On-Premise.

In this scenario, we'll deploy an On-Premise solution. To begin the installation, click the **Add Cluster** button and select the cluster type of **Custom**.

Provide a friendly name for the cluster, such as `k8s-katacoda-staging-1`{{copy}}

In the next step we'll add additional nodes to the cluster.
